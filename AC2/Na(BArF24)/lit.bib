abstract  ="A modified{,} convenient{,} preparation of solvent-free{,} anhydrous{,} Li+{,} Na+ and K+ salts of the ubiquitous [BArF4]− anion is reported{,} that involves a simple additional recrystallisation step. Anhydrous Na[BArF4]{,} K[BArF4]{,} and [Li(H2O)][BArF4]{,} were characterised by single-crystal X-ray diffraction."
